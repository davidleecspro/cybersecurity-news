**San Francisco, CA** â€“ In a recent cybersecurity incident, CyberDefenders successfully defended against a sophisticated ransomware attack targeting a major healthcare provider. The attack, which aimed to steal sensitive patient data and extort the institution, was intercepted and mitigated by the quick actions of the CyberDefenders team.

David Lee, the Chief Security Officer at CyberDefenders, led the response efforts. "Our team worked tirelessly to contain the breach and secure the compromised systems," Lee said. "We are committed to protecting our clients from these types of malicious activities."
